## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your laptop:
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Flutter** (for running the project)
- **An IDE** (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio)

## Steps to Pull and Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, open a terminal or Git Bash on your laptop. Then, clone the repository by running the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/gagandeepkaur15/marble-game.git```


### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder:
```cd marble-game```


### 3. Install Flutter Dependencies
Make sure you have Flutter installed and configured correctly on your machine. To install the required dependencies for the project, run the following command:
```flutter pub get```


This will fetch all the necessary packages and dependencies defined in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

### 4. Run the Project
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project on an emulator or a connected physical device. To start the game, use the following command:
```flutter run```


This will launch the game on the default device.

### 5. Play the Game
Now that the app is running, you can start playing the game by:
- Dragging marbles to drop them onto the 4x4 game board.
- Using the timer to make strategic moves within the given time limit.
- Trying to align four marbles in a row to win the game.
